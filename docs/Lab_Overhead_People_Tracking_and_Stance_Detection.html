Version 1.0.0
=============

Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to count and track multiple people simultaneously when the sensor is mounted overhead. Using the IWR6843 ES1.0 ODS, detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the device to localize people and track their movement with a high degree of accuracy. The algorithms are also set to ignore static objects such as desks or chairs, as well as detect if each tracked person is standing or sitting. The lab runs on the TI mmWave IWR6843 ES1.0 ODS.
